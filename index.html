        <h1>Hi, here's a little about me:</h1>
				
		<p>I recently took an HTML class even though I'm somewhat familiar with it     already. I also took a CSS class which I got a lot of new material out of. I'm pretty happy to be able to get these classes. I'm treating them as a refresher for all the self study I've done, and prep work for the  web developer boot camp I'm planning to attend soon. 
		</p>
        
        <p>I've also taken a JavaScript course which didn't go quite as expected. There was a mix up and the instructor was provided the wrong course materials.  A business group were the only other students and they pulled out when they learned they weren't going to get what they were expecting. This left me as the only student. The teacher and I decided to cover some other topics as well and I got some great stuff out of it.  But I plan to take it again unless I'm in a boot camp by then.</p>
            
        <p>Prior to all this I've been playing around with WordPress and MediaWiki (aka Wikipedia) for a few years. I first got interested when I client asked me to take over his WordPress based web sites for him. I got into MediaWiki because I wanted something to act as my own personal knowledge base and online notebook.             </p>
            
        <h3>Some coding and tech I've studied:</h3>
        <p>
         HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, WordPress, PhP, MySQL, Media Wiki, Linux, etc.   
        </p>
		
		<h3>What I've been doing.</h3>
		<p>I've been in tech for 20 years.  Starting in helpdesk and desktop support, moving up to systems and network administration, and doing many things in between. But I've essentially been a high tech handy man the whole time.  I don't get excited about what I've been doing and it's time to move on.  I decided coding is more interesting and affords me opportunities to do other cool things too.
		</p>
            
        <h3>What I plan to do.</h3>
		<p>The same thing we do every night Pinky. Try to take over the world.
		</p>
        <p>Or maybe just continue learning about web development and programming and start a new career. I also intend to learn mobile development and other things as well. This is just the beginning.</p>
            
        <h3>Other stuff.</h3>
		<p>I dabble at photography.  I took the pictures on this site.</p>
        <p>This web page / site will serve as a personal bio and a place for me to practice and demonstrate what I've learned.  It's very simple now as I've really just begun.  But check back often.  See my to-do list below for an idea of coming changes.</p>
